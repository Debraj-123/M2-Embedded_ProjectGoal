# 3. When it is needed?
Heated seats can make cars much more comfortable in the winter, or for those who often get cold even in the summer. The heater in most vehicles work well, but the car's seat warmer is close to your body allowing you to warm up faster. In some cases, the seat warms up before the rest of the vehicle does.

# 4. Why are you making it?
A heated seat allows a driver to remove their bulky overcoat giving them improved arm and leg flexibility with a concomitant improvement in driving control. Similarly, being warmly nestled in a heated seat allows the driver to focus on his driving instead of his discomfort in a cold seat.

# 5. How are you making it? / How feature implemented in it?
Heated seats are powered by a heating element, a long strip of material that functions as a resistor. A resistor resists the flow of electricity. When electric current flows through it, the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.
